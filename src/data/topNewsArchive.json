He confirmed Treasury's forecast that the economy will shrink by $50 billion, or 10 per cent, in the June quarter amid the coronavirus restrictions that have shut down swathes of businesses. Mr Frydenberg also outlined the boost to jobs and GDP expected during the three-stage relaxing of restrictions between now and July. Once the third stage is reached, the economy should be $9.4 billion a month better off and 850,000 Australians should be back in work."

These four meatworks represent 35 per cent of beef exports to China, a trade that had been on track to reach $3.5 billion this year. There are fears the barriers introduced by Australia's largest trading partner are in retaliation to Prime Minister Scott Morrison's demand for an independent investigation into the COVID-19 outbreak."
