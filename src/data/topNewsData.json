            "summary": "Victoria will forge ahead with loosening coronavirus restrictions on Monday as experts worry the state could be at the \"tipping point\" of a second wave of infections. Thirteen new COVID-19 cases were reported in Victoria on Friday - the third successive day with a double-digit rise. Professor James McCaw, an epidemiologist with the Doherty Institute who has worked on government modelling during the pandemic, said it was fair to ask whether Victoria should be loosening the rules on June 22."

From 12.01am on July 17, people who enter the Territory from other states will no longer have to go into quarantine. It also means Territorians will be able to travel to the rest of Australia to see friends and family without having to serve 14 days' quarantine on their return."
