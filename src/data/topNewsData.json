Mr Marshall last week announced coronavirus testing for everyone crossing the border from Victoria within 24 hours of their arrival, and again on day 12 of their quarantine. But today he said the tests would be mandatory, and that anyone who did not comply with that requirement would be subject to a $1,000 on-the-spot fine."

In announcing the figures, Premier Daniel Andrews said it was \"way too early\" for the state to be moving to a new stage of restrictions. Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said Victoria may not yet have hit the peak of its latest surge in cases. Professor Sutton said the virus had an average incubation period of about five or six days, which meant case numbers would not start to plateau for another few days."

With Victoria reporting another 238 cases of the illness, and another fatality, Sutton said he would \"love\" elimination, but now wasn’t the time to make \"a detailed examination about its feasibility\". He said any shift in the public health strategy would require consideration by chief medical officers and leaders through the national cabinet."
