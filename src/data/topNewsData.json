The border closure decision was made in consultation with Prime Minister Scott Morrison and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, Mr Andrews said. The decision marks the first time the Victoria-NSW border has been shut in 100 years - officials last blocked movement between the two states in 1919 during the Spanish flu pandemic."
