            "summary": "Today brings a raft of eased NSW coronavirus restrictions right in time for school holidays, but the winter break is going to look a little different this year. From today, indoor venues including pubs, cafes and restaurants, as well as functions, can hold any number of people, as long as they remain seated and stick to one person per four square metres. This also includes weddings, which were previously subjected to separate limitations and capped at 20 guests. A maximum of 10,000 fans are allowed to fill stadiums for sporting or cultural events from today, while community sport can resume for kids and adults alike. The State Government has increased the capacity of public transport services from today, allowing 68 passengers on a train and 23 on a bus — double the cap implemented in May."

The prime minister has also warned people who refuse to be checked for the disease could face fines as a hotspot testing blitz continues. But Mr Andrews said Victorians will not be forced into taking tests in the lockdown areas because it would be logistically difficult and only possible if police accompanied testing staff door to door."
