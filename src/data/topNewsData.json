            "summary": "The Morrison government is considering bringing forward income tax cuts and will extend income support beyond September, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has said. Frydenberg and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, have been increasingly frank about the need for the extension of economic supports as Victoria re-enters a six-week lockdown to fight the spread of Covid-19. Although the income tax cut proposal is yet to go to cabinet and the governmentâ€™s decision on extending the $70bn jobkeeper program will not be announced until 23 July, Victorian businesses are requesting an extra two months of wage subsidies citing the new lockdown. It comes as banks have announced they will extend the six-month suspension of loan repayments by a further four months for business loan and mortgage customers who are still experiencing financial hardship."
