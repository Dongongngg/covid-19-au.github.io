Under Mr Morrison's plan, funding would be more closely linked to skill gaps based on what businesses need.

Mr Morrison made the case to ditch a \"clunky and unresponsive\" system in favour of more consistency across states and greater transparency around spending. Mr Morrison will flag changes to the funding model which sees $1.5 billion of federal cash flow to state governments annually for skills and training."
