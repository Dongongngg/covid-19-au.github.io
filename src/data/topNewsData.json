            "summary": "In an interview with progressive think-thank the Australian Institute, Elliot Harris a UN Chief Economist, has said Australias and other countries around the world to invest in clean energy and take more ambitious action against climate change. Elliot is currently helping to lead the UN's development of policy advice for nations grappling with the pandemic. \"What we’ve seen in this COVID crisis is that governments are indeed capable of really ambitious, rather unorthodox and extremely important and even massive interventions,\" he said, adding \"I can think of no stakes that are higher than the climate crisis that we are living in right now.\" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has stressed that coal should not be part of any nation's stimulus plan, and a number of Australian business leaders have also pressured the Federal Government to invest in renewable energy."
