Ms Mikakos said the state of emergency had been extended to allow the Chief Health Officer to continue to issue fresh legal directions. The recent spike in cases has prompted the Government to bring back some tougher restrictions, including limiting visitors inside homes to five people and outdoor gatherings to 10 people from midnight tonight. But some restrictions will still be relaxed, including allowing gyms to reopen from tomorrow."
